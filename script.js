        content: 'A character encoding is a system that pairs each character from a given repertoire with something else‚Äîsuch as a sequence of natural numbers, octets, or electrical pulses‚Äîin order to facilitate the storage of text in computers and the transmission of text through telecommunication networks. ASCII was an early standard that could only represent 128 characters (English letters, numbers, symbols). Unicode is a modern standard that aims to represent every character from every language. UTF-8 is the most common implementation of Unicode.', 
        interviewTip: 'Show you understand that text is just numbers underneath. Explain that ASCII is a subset of UTF-8 and why Unicode is necessary for a global internet.'

        content: 'A distributed, immutable ledger. It is a growing list of records, called blocks, that are securely linked together using cryptography. Each block contains a cryptographic hash of the previous block, a timestamp, and transaction data. This design makes it resistant to modification of its data because once recorded, the data in any given block cannot be altered retroactively without altering all subsequent blocks.', 
        interviewTip: 'You don\'t need to be a crypto expert. Describe it as a "distributed database with a trust protocol." Mention its key properties: decentralization, immutability, and transparency. Bitcoin is the most famous application.'

The basic unit of memory is the quantum bit or "qubit". While classical computers store information as bits (0s or 1s), qubits can exist in a superposition of both states simultaneously.', 
        interviewTip: 'This is a forward-looking topic. Explain that it is not meant to replace classical computers but to solve specific types of problems that are intractable for them, such as integer factorization (breaking modern cryptography) and simulating quantum systems.'
